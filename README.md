# EnvDataProj_GME

### Problem and Framing
The environmental problem we want to address with this project is the impact of chemical runoff into freshwater environments, more specifically the organisms that live in those environments. There are two different ways of approaching this problem with the data we found. One way is analyzing the experimental data of the effects of sodium nitrate (commonly found in fertilizer) and sodium sulfate (commonly found in household products) on different species. This analysis would be directed towards governmental and regulatory bodies to inform and influence policy about pollutant runoff. The other approach would analyze the data provided by the EPA to determine which bodies of water and which species are at the most risk of harm from chemical pollutants. This would include looking at the chemical pollutants in freshwater in different spaces, the types of species in those habitats, and the determined threshold for those organisms. The purpose of this project would be to identify high risk areas and convince research agencies that further research is critical.

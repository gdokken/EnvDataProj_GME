# EnvDataProj_GME

### Problem and Framing
The environmental problem we want to address with this project is the impact of chemical runoff into freshwater environments, more specifically the organisms that live in those environments. There are two different ways of approaching this problem with the data we found. One way is analyzing the experimental data of the effects of sodium nitrate (commonly found in fertilizer) and sodium sulfate (commonly found in household products) on different species. This analysis would be directed towards governmental and regulatory bodies to inform and influence policy about pollutant runoff. The other approach would analyze the data provided by the EPA to determine which bodies of water and which species are at the most risk of harm from chemical pollutants. This would include looking at the chemical pollutants in freshwater in different spaces, the types of species in those habitats, and the determined threshold for those organisms. The purpose of this project would be to identify high risk areas and convince research agencies that further research is critical.

### Data Exploration
Aquatic Life Benchmarks
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/aquatic-life-benchmarks
The Aquatic Life Benchmarks is the baseline for when various chemicals become toxic for different organisms. The dataset categorizes organisms into different categories like Freshwater Vertebrates and Freshwater Invertebrates. There is compiled data from many different studies between roughly 2014 to 2025.

TRACI spatial Eutrophication EPA
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traci-spatial-eutrophication-characterization-factors-2020-10
The TRACI dataset is about various resources in different areas of the United States. The data set has many different levels within it. The first level is data looking at different forms of agricultural waste as well as non agricultural waste and how they affect different states and territories. They measure the levels in both fresh water and marine waters. As you go further into the data things get broken down even further into county data and as large as country data.
